// CCanvasMode is the architectural spine of the plugin: the single authority
// that decides whether a given workspace is currently in infinite-canvas mode.
//
// The contract that guarantees non-destructiveness:
//   * Every input hook / render hook / dispatcher gates on isCanvas(ws).
//   * If no workspace is in canvas mode, the plugin changes NOTHING about
//     Hyprland's behaviour. enter()/leave() are the only mutating ops, and
//     leave() must fully restore the workspace to its pre-canvas state.
//
// Camera = Approach B (see FINDINGS.md): canvas windows are floated so the tiling
// algo stops re-positioning them, then pan moves their real positions. enter()
// saves each window's pre-canvas floating-state + geometry; leave() restores it.
